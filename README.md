# Machine Learning A (University of Copenhagen)

This repository presents my **independent re-implementations and analyses** inspired by the *Machine Learning A* course at the University of Copenhagen.  
The focus is on combining rigorous mathematical theory with practical algorithmic implementation — bridging **statistics, programming, and machine learning theory**.

---

## Learning Focus

The projects explore both **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning through analytical derivations and Python implementations.

### Core Topics
- **Supervised Learning:** Linear & Logistic Regression, Perceptron, k-Nearest Neighbors  
- **Unsupervised Learning:** PCA, k-Means, k-Means++  
- **Tree-Based Models:** Decision Trees, Random Forests  
- **Theory:** Concentration Inequalities (Markov, Chebyshev, Hoeffding) and Generalization Bounds  
- **Regularization & Overfitting:** Ridge / Lasso, feature transformations, model-complexity control  
- **Neural Networks:** Introduction to Deep Learning principles

##  Repository Structure
- `Assignment1/` – Supervised learning & KNN fundamentals  
- `Assignment2/` – Linear regression and gradient descent  
- `Assignment3/` – Regularization and model selection  
- `Assignment4/` – Generalization bounds and theory proofs  
- `Assignment5/` – Tree-based algorithms  
- `Assignment6/` – PCA and clustering  
- `Assignment7/` – Neural networks and deep learning introduction  

Each folder contains:
- **Code:** Python implementations (NumPy / scikit-learn)  
- **Visuals:** Model outputs, evaluation plots  
- **Discussion:** Reflections and theoretical explanations written independently

##  Portfolio Purpose

This portfolio demonstrates my ability to:
- **Translate statistical and mathematical theory into working ML models**  
- **Implement algorithms from first principles and validate performance**  
- **Diagnose overfitting and reason about generalization**  
- **Write clear, reproducible, and well-structured analysis code**

It represents my **personal work and understanding**, not official KU solutions.
