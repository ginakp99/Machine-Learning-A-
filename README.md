# Machine Learning A

This repository contains assignments, solutions, and reports from the course **Machine Learning A** at the University of Copenhagen.

## ðŸ“˜ Course Overview
The course introduces fundamental concepts, theory, and algorithms in machine learning, with focus on both **mathematical foundations** and **practical implementation**.  
Topics include:
- Supervised Learning: Classification & Regression
- Unsupervised Learning: Clustering & Dimensionality Reduction
- Generalization bounds and concentration inequalities
- Algorithms: k-NN, Perceptron, Logistic/Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Neural Networks
- PCA and feature transformations
- Regularization and overfitting analysis

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- `Assignment1/` â€“ First assignment (code, solutions, results)
- `Assignment2/` â€“ Second assignment
- `Assignment3/` â€“ Third assignment
- (and so on...)

Each assignment folder contains:
- **Code** (Python)
- **Report/solutions** (PDF/HTML/Notebook)
- **Results/plots**

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This repository showcases my work in machine learning, demonstrating:
- Ability to apply and implement ML algorithms
- Theoretical understanding of generalization and model evaluation
- Skills in writing clear, reproducible code and structured reports
