# Machine Learning A

This repository contains my solutions, code, and reports from the **Machine Learning A** course at the University of Copenhagen.  
The course combines rigorous mathematical foundations with hands-on algorithmic implementation — bridging theory and practice in modern machine learning.

## Course Focus

The assignments explore both **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning through analytical proofs and Python implementations.

### Covered Topics
- **Supervised Learning:** Linear & Logistic Regression, Perceptron, k-Nearest Neighbors  
- **Unsupervised Learning:** PCA, k-Means, k-Means++  
- **Tree-Based Methods:** Decision Trees, Random Forests  
- **Theory:** Concentration Inequalities (Markov, Chebyshev, Hoeffding), Generalization Bounds (finite & countable hypothesis classes)  
- **Regularization & Overfitting:** Ridge / Lasso, feature transformations, model complexity control  
- **Neural Networks:** Introduction to Deep Learning concepts  



## Repository Structure
- `Assignment1/` – First assignment (code, solutions, results)
- `Assignment2/` – Second assignment
- `Assignment3/` – Third assignment
- (and so on...)

Each folder includes:
- **Code:** Python implementation from scratch and scikit-learn comparisons  
- **Results:** Visualizations and evaluation metrics  
- **Report:** Analytical derivations, theoretical proofs, and interpretation  


## Portfolio Purpose

This repository demonstrates my ability to:
- **Translate mathematical theory into working ML code**  
- **Analyze model generalization and overfitting using statistical reasoning**  
- **Implement and interpret core algorithms from first principles**  
- **Produce reproducible, well-documented machine learning pipelines**
